immer auf der Frage auf der man gerade ist links im summary markieren
---
hat eine kleine tücke weil man immer die bereits nächste frage noch ohne
antwort im summary anzeigen muss

@TODO
@reviewed with doctors
summary on the left of all the answers and the answered questions
---
think about adding the question type to the form-content dictionary
@TODO better write a module in there make a verifcation if the questions
has next_yes, options or placeholder attribute and if so map the correct url
like question-options?code=...
---
this could also be useful in a later term when the advanced form is created
since only questions from type binary lead to a new form full of questions

@TODO
@reviewed with doctors
a site for pros
where only binary questions are displayed solo
after that the full branch with input and options question is displayed
in a single container form

### not necessary todos but for presentation in teh clinic would be nice

@TODO
implement a config file where a service can read the current state of
the active theme
----
have a look at how it s done by the ervice that reads and writes from the questionaries.json

eventually use a base handler for this

in the rpepare method or womewhere there figure out which state is active


@TODO
make a simple json file with questions to the stomach pain protocol
something small but try to read in a bit on wiki -> so it looks quite
realistic


@TODO
prepare a simple insert of a question
and a asimple remove of a question
so can show that this is easy to handle
----
the questions might be handled quite similar to a list
since when inserting a new question or when remov one the direct naibors (next
and previous) of the inserted or removed question need to be relinked


@TODO
make the slides animated in and out
---
evetnually just skip this since the original idea was to keep it simple
