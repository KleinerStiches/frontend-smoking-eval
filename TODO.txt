@DONE
when click on the bianry buttons switch the opposite button yes or no
to DISABLED
----
@CHANGED
disabled does not work
better create a logic that makes the label point to somehting else
than the correct id
---
then when press the button write back the key
something like
class="opposite-active-id"
---
at the very beginning of the button check if the
multicollpase is arady on the targets and the targets have
NOT class collapsed
---
then do nothing
* solved by added pointer-events: none as css class to the currently active
button. class held in smoking_eval\css\advanced-view\disabled-switch.css

@TODO
when go back to an already answerd question delete all answers until this
question. since can not only delete to the last binary
---
since the binary can be in the wrong tree

@TODO
instead of lorem ipsum ... in the /home page
---
write an instruction how this questioning is going to work
1. regitration
2. chose how to solve the questioning
3. when finished the data is stored and get redirected back to home

@TODO
update when clicked on a question in the summary the question with the answer
that was once given by the user
---
this could be easy
in the controller check if there is an answer matching this code
then pass over either None or the answer

in the view then if answer is not none display or checkthe answer

@TODO
realtime verification in js for the input question

---
create a link in the home page and replace the lorem ipsum
the link references the new app and does redirect to the pinboard page

@TODO
implement a config file where a service can read the current state of
the active theme
----
have a look at how it s done by the ervice that reads and writes from the questionaries.json

eventually use a base handler for this

in the rpepare method or womewhere there figure out which state is active


@TODO
make a simple json file with questions to the stomach pain protocol
something small but try to read in a bit on wiki -> so it looks quite
realistic
---
example data from other themes show up with the genericness of the app


@TODO
make the slides animated in and out
---
evetnually just skip this since the original idea was to keep it simple
